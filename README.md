# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This challenge was meant to help showcase skills on using the Open Weather Api. I was tasked with completing this assignment from scratch, as no starter code was given. I tried to use Bootstrap to help simplify my formatting, and then I got to work on the functionality. I was able to dynamically create the current weather section, but struggled a bit with the forecast section as that needed to be done in a different way. All in all, I'm glad to have done this challenge and I'm excited to continue working with Apis and mastering this skill.
